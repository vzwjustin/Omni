**Omni Cortex** is an MCP server that gives Claude access to **62 advanced reasoning frameworks** through Gemini-powered orchestration. Gemini thinks deeply about your problem and generates ultra-efficient execution briefs for Claude.

> **"Gemini orchestrates. Claude executes. You ship faster."**

## 🏗️ Architecture: Gemini Orchestrates, Claude Executes

```
User Query → Claude → Gemini (via MCP) → Structured Context → Claude Executes
                          ↓
              1. Analyze intent & extract keywords
              2. Discover relevant files (with scoring)
              3. Search code (grep/ripgrep/git)
              4. Fetch documentation from web
              5. Query ChromaDB knowledge base (16K+ examples)
              6. Structure everything into organized brief
```

### How It Works

1. **User asks Claude** a question
2. **Claude calls Omni-Cortex** (MCP tool)
3. **Gemini Context Gateway** does the heavy lifting:
   - Analyzes query to understand intent
   - Discovers relevant files with relevance scoring
   - Searches codebase via grep/git
   - Fetches web documentation if needed
   - Queries ChromaDB for similar past solutions (16K+ examples)
   - Selects optimal framework chain (62 available)
   - Generates token-efficient execution brief (20% format savings)
4. **Claude receives structured context** and executes

### Key Design
- **Gemini burns tokens freely** (1M context) - does ALL the heavy thinking
- **Claude gets full context** with 20% token savings via efficient formatting
- **Cost**: ~$0.0001 per query (virtually free with Gemini's free tier)

## 🔮 Vibe-Based Routing

You don't need to ask for "Active Inference" or "Chain of Verification." Just speak naturally:

| You Say | Selected Strategy |
|:---|:---|
| *"WTF is wrong with this? It's failing randomly!"* | `active_inference` → Hypothesis Testing Loop |
| *"This code is spaghetti. Kill it with fire."* | `graph_of_thoughts` → Dependency disentanglement |
| *"Is this actually secure? Check for hacks."* | `chain_of_verification` → Red Teaming & Auditing |
| *"I have no idea how to start this weird problem."* | `self_discover` → First Principles exploration |
| *"Make it faster. It's too slow."* | `tree_of_thoughts` → Optimization Search |
| *"Make the tests pass, fix the CI."* | `tdd_prompting` → Test-Driven Development |

---

## 🔗 Framework Chaining

For complex tasks, Omni chains multiple frameworks together in a pipeline:

```
Category Router → Specialist Agent → Framework Chain → Pipeline Executor
      ↓                   ↓                  ↓               ↓
  "debug"         Debug Detective      [fw1 → fw2 → fw3]   Execute each
  "code_gen"      Code Architect               ↓           in sequence
  "refactor"      Refactor Surgeon     Pass state between
      ...                              frameworks
```

### Example: Complex Bug Fix

When you say *"This async handler crashes randomly under load"*:

1. **Category Match** → `debug` (vibe: "crashes", "randomly")
2. **Specialist Decision** → Debug Detective selects chain
3. **Pipeline Execution**:
   ```
   self_ask         →  "What exactly are we debugging?"
   active_inference →  Hypothesis testing loop
   verify_and_edit  →  Validate fix, patch only what's wrong
   ```

## 📋 ClaudeCodeBrief Format (NEW)

The structured handoff protocol optimizes for Claude Max subscriptions:

```
[DEBUG] Fix user auth failing after password reset
→ auth/password.py:L45-67 auth/session.py
  • authentication
  ⊘ auth/oauth.py

1. Check reset_password() return value
2. Verify session invalidation after reset
3. Add token refresh call after password change

✓ pytest tests/auth/ -v
• All tests pass
• Auth flow works

⚠ Preserve existing functionality
⚠ Do not break API

• [FILE] auth/password.py:L45
  → returns None instead of new token
• [FILE] auth/session.py:L78
  → does not invalidate old tokens

⛔ If required inputs missing, request them
```

**20% token savings** via bullet points, full information preserved.

## ⚡ Installation

### Option 1: Docker Pull
```bash
docker pull vzwjustin/omni-cortex:latest
```

### Option 2: Add to MCP Config
Add to your IDE's MCP settings (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omni-cortex": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-v", "/path/to/your/code:/code",
        "vzwjustin/omni-cortex:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧩 Framework Architecture (Modular)

The 62 frameworks are organized into a clean, modular structure:

### Single Source of Truth
```
app/frameworks/
├── __init__.py         # Exposes FRAMEWORKS dict
└── registry.py         # ALL 62 framework definitions (76KB)
```

Each framework is defined as a `FrameworkDefinition` dataclass:
```python
FrameworkDefinition(
    name="active_inference",
    display_name="Active Inference",
    category=FrameworkCategory.ITERATIVE,
    description="Debugging loop: hypothesis → predict → compare → update",
    best_for=["debugging", "error analysis", "root cause investigation"],
    vibes=["why is this broken", "wtf is wrong", "find the bug", ...],
    steps=["HYPOTHESIS: Form hypothesis", "PREDICT: Expected behavior", ...],
    complexity="medium",
    task_type="debug",
)
```

### Node Implementations (By Category)
```
app/nodes/
├── common.py           # Shared logic for all nodes
├── generator.py        # Dynamic prompt generator (uses registry)
│
├── strategy/           # ReasonFlux, Self-Discover, Plan-and-Solve...
├── search/             # Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, MCTS...
├── iterative/          # Active Inference, Reflexion, Self-Refine...
├── code/               # Program of Thoughts, Chain of Code, TDD...
├── context/            # Chain of Note, Step-Back, Buffer of Thoughts...
├── fast/               # System1, Scaffolding (quick responses)
├── verification/       # Chain of Verification, Self-Consistency...
├── agent/              # SWE-Agent, ReWOO, LATS...
└── rag/                # HyDE, RAG-Fusion, RAPTOR, GraphRAG...
```

### How It Works
```
1. User query → HyperRouter matches vibes in registry.py
2. Category identified → Specialist selects framework(s)
3. Framework chain selected → generator.py builds prompts from steps
4. Node executes → Category-specific logic in nodes/{category}/
5. Result returned → Formatted as ClaudeCodeBrief
```

### Why This Structure?
- **Single Source of Truth**: Add/modify frameworks in ONE file
- **Vibe Matching**: Natural language → framework selection
- **Modular Nodes**: Category-specific execution logic
- **Prompt Generation**: Steps are templates, generator fills in context
